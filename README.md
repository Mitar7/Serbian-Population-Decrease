# Serbian-Population-Decrease
Since the 1990s, Serbia’s population has been gradually declining. At 9.88 million in 1995, the population is now 8.74 million in 2020. 
According to current projections, the population will be cut in half by the end of the century with an estimated 4.28 million people by the end of 2099. 
Serbia’s population decreased at a rate of 0.40% from 2019 to 2020, resulting in a population loss of about 35,000 people.
This population decline rate has been increasing every year since 2015. The fertility rate is low at 1.46 births per woman.
Additionally, Serbia has a “brain drain,” where the most educated skilled people leave to other countries to find better opportunities. 
The population decline is considered a national emergency by the Serbian government, who enlisted the help of the United Nations to try and slow the shrinking.
This is a problem that requires more attention and actions to reach final solution.
